File:
-----
* A file is a collection of data stored in one unit, identified by a filename. 

* It can be a document, picture, audio or video stream, data library, application, or other collection of data.

File System:
------------
* A filesystem is the methods and data structures that an operating system uses to keep track of files on a disk or partition; 

* This is the way the files are organized on the disk. 

Disadvantages of the file system:
---------------------------------
1.  Data Redundancy

2.  Difficulty in Accessing Data

3.  Limited Data Sharing

4.  Integrity Problems

5.  Concurrent Access problem

6.  Security Problems


Database :

* A database is an collection  of data that is organized to be easily accessed, managed and updated  to relational databases.


Database Model:
----------------

* A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized and manipulated.


 The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format.


Types of database models

1.Hierarchical database model.

2.Relational model.

3.Network model.

4.Object-oriented database model.


Hierarchical Database Model:
----------------------------
* A Hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data are organized into a tree-like structure.

* The data are stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value.


ex:  hierarchical databases is Windows Registry in the Microsoft Windows operating systems.



Network Database Model:
-----------------------
Network database model is a model for modeling the entities in such a way that one child entity can have more than one parent entities.

Characteristics of network model:
----------------------------------

* More better than hierarchical model.

* Supports many to many relationships.

* Many parent can have many child.

* Many child can have many parents.

* Complex structure.
    
* Not very flexible to reorganize the model.
    
* Query facility is not available in network model.

Object Oriented Database Model: (MVC)
-------------------------------
* Object Oriented Database (OODB) provides all the facilities associated with object oriented paradigm.

*  It enables us to create classes, organize objects, structure an inheritance hierarchy and call methods of other classes. 

Basic concept oops:
-------------------
1.object
2.class
3.inheritance
4.polymorphism
5.Data Abstraction
6.Data Encapsulation
7.Dynamic binding
8.Message passing

4.Relational database Model - oracle


Plsql operators:
----------------
Arithmetical operators:
-----------------------
+ addition
- subtract
* multiply
/ division (quotient)

Mathematical function:
Mod() - division remainder

ex:

10 + 3 => 13
10 - 3 => 7
10 * 3 => 30
10 / 3 = 3
mod(10,3) =1

Relational operators or Comparision operators:
----------------------------------------------
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
= equal to
!= or <> not equal to

a>b

Logical operators:
----------------
and
or
not
	and
a	b	c=a*b
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	0
1	1	1

Note : if all input values are true then output is true else false.

	or
a	b	c=a+b
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	1

Note: if any one input values are true then output is true else false.

	not
a	c
0	1
1	0


Special operators:
-----------------
in
not in
between 
not between
like
not like
is null
is not null

Set operators:
---------------
union 
union all
intersect
minus

Assignment operators:
--------------------
:=
a:=100
b:=200
c:=a+b
Concatenation operators:
------------------------
|| - pipe line char

10 + 20 = 30

'sql' || 'school' = sqlschool


Plsql datatypes / Fieldtypes:
-----------------------------
character datatypes(a to z and 0 to 9)
----------------------------------------

char(2000) - fixed length char - 1 byte - Ascii - Static memory allocation 
- ANSI Syntax

varchar(2000) - Variant length char - 1 byte - Ascii - Dynamic memory allocatin - ANSI syntax

varchar2(4000) - Variant length char - 1 byte - Ascii - Dynamic memory allocation - Oracle syntax

Nchar(40) - Fixed length char - 2 bytes - Unicode  - static memory allocation - Ansi syntax

Nvarchar(40) - Variant length char - 2 bytes - Unicode - Dynamic memory allocation

Number datatypes:(0 to 9)
-------------------------
number(10) => 10 digits
number(10,2) => 9999999.99
int - 4 bytes
or
INTEGER - 4 bytes

Decimal point datatypes:
------------------------
float - 4 bytes (approx. 7 decimal digits)
