			SUB-QUERIES
			-------------
 A Sub Query is also a query, which is defined under a main query.

First Query is also called as outer query  or main query and second query is also called as inner query or subquery.

It always sends values to its nearest main query. 

Server first sub query executed based on the sub query value main query will get executed.

If a sub query send single value to its nearest main query then that sub query is called Single--Valued-Sub query. ex: (select sum(sal) from emp)

If a sub query sends multiple values to its nearest main query then that sub query is called Multi-Valued-Sub query.ex:(select sal from emp);

Note: If a sub query sends multiple values to its nearest main query then we have to use IN or NOT IN operator between Main query and Sub query.

Single valued/Row Subquery:
-----------------------
SELECT * FROM TABLENAME WHERE COLUMNNAME = 
(SELECT STATEMENT WHERE CONDITION)

Multi valued/row subquery:
----------------------
select * from tablename where columname in
 (select statement where condition)

Types of Subquery:
------------------
1.Nested Subquery / Uncorrelated Subquery
	a.single valued/row subquery - where 
	b.multi valued/row subquery  - where 
	c.Multi column valued subquery - from
2.Correlated Subquery

Multiple Row Subquery:

When subquery returns multiple rows. It is called multiple row salary.
Note: we should multiple row operators with multiple row subqueries. They are three multiple row operators.
1.	IN = MATCHING
2.	ANY <=MATCHING
3.	ALL >=MATCHING



EXAMPLE FOR ALL OPERATORS:
--------------------------

Select ENAME,EMPNO,SAL,DEPTNO from emp
		Where sal > ALL
(Select sal from emp Where deptno = 30)


Ex: Select * from emp where sal < ALL(1600,2500,1250,3000,950);

*ANY: Select * from emp where sal > ANY(select sal from emp                 where deptno = 30);	

Select * from emp where sal < Any(select sal from emp where deptno = 30);

*IN: Select * from emp where ename IN('ALLEN', 'KING','FORD');

Select * from emp where sal IN(select sal from emp where deptno = 30);


/
select * from emp where sal  in(select sal from emp where deptno=30) --matching
select * from emp where sal >=all(select sal from emp where deptno=30)  --above matching
select * from emp where sal <=any(select sal from emp where deptno=30) --below matching
select * from emp where sal in(1600,1250,2850,1500,950)  --matching
select * from emp where sal >=all(1600,1250,2850,1500,950) --above matching
select * from emp where sal <=any(1600,1250,2850,1500,950) --below matching




Types of Subquery:
--------------------
1.Nested Subquery --  Table level execution - static value
2.Correlated Subquery -- Row level execution -dynamic value

--display all emp details whose earning salary
above avg.salary of deptno 10.(2916)

--display all emp details whose earning salary
above avg.salary of deptno 20. (2175)

--display all emp details whose earning salary
above avg.salary of deptno 30. (1566)

--client requirement

--display all emp details whose earning salary
above avg.salary of respective dept or him dept or her dept.

select ename,empno,sal,deptno from emp e
where sal>=(select avg(sal) from emp where deptno=e.deptno);





CORRELATED SUB QUERIES: (ROW BY ROW)
------------------------------------

SELECT ENAME,EMPNO,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP e  WHERE SAL >=
(SELECT AVG(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=e.deptno)

Correlated Subquery:

	These queries provide different execution to nested query, where it first executes Outer query and then executes inner query.

	Nested query is called uni-directional query whereas Corelated Sub Query is called bi-directional query.

	Corelated Sub Query will always gets executed in the following way;
	"First outer query gets executed, extracts 1 row at a time(candidate row) and that row is given to inner query for processing, inner query will provide its output to outer query and based on the condition outer query will display the extracted record".

--Example:
---------
10 - 2916
20 - 2073
30 - 1566

--display all emp details whose earning salary above avg.salary of respective dept or him dept or her dept.

10 - 2916
20 - 2073
30 - 1566



select ename,empno,sal,deptno,mgr from emp e where sal>=
(select avg(sal) from emp where deptno=e.deptno)


--display max salary for each dept and corresponding emp details
select * from emp e where sal=(select max(sal) from emp where deptno=e.deptno)

--display min salary for each dept and corresponding emp details
select * from emp e where sal=(select min(sal) from emp where deptno=e.deptno)


--display all emp details whose earning salary nth highest salary where n=10
select * from emp e where 10=(select count(distinct (sal)) from emp where sal>=e.sal)
